%	Independent reading course paper (proposal): {\bf Mechanism and Outcome of Leveraging in China's Real Estate Market}\hfill12/2023\smallskip\\
%	{\sl In China, real estate developers leverage through low-interest rates obtained by the down payment of pre-sale properties and holding land (as collateral), creating an expanding credit cycle. I plan to study this issue by using the financial accelerator proposed by BGG (1999), and use a HANK model to describe relationships among households(as investor or not), real estate developers, state-owned enterprises, local governments, and commercial banks. And predict the risk under shocks.}\medskip\\
